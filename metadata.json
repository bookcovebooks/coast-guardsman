Caught between duty and honor, Aubrey Sears must confront smugglers, treacherous colleagues, and his own doubts in a desperate fight that will determine not only his future in the service but his chance at love. In the shadowy world of Prohibition-era rum-runners and opium smugglers, one man's courage will expose a web of lies that reaches to the heart of his own station.",
